!! Tryout

!!! Auto generation

With the following i-message layout, you can create entries where the `title` field is a random ID and the `caption` field is the real title.

!!! Manual creation

Create a new tiddler, then add the `caption` field, or the `_is_titleless` field.

Once added, you'll notice that the old "title" edit box becomes an edit box for the `caption` field, and the edit box for the `title` field is now a smaller, secondary input box.
